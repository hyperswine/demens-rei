# Demens

Demens in the Terra Engine.

Demens is a civilisation + cities skylines + company of heroes type game. It is hexed, resourced and united like civ6. It is resource deposited, laidout and etc. like cities skylines with building levels and building types like cities skylines. District and subdistrict buildings like civ6. Units like CoH2, building time like CoH2 and repair time and movement time. Resources move like in cities skylines with trucks and such spawning automatically as long as there is a connection. Connections are autobuilt like in civ6 but custom connections can also be extended from existing connections.

Hmm, maybe it can be more like cities skylines without hexes.
